# iLidar-ToF
iLidar-ToF is a 3D solid state LiDAR that offers an extremely cost-effective solution compared to traditional LiDAR sensors on the market. It features a solid-state design without any moving parts and a high efficiency optical system, allowing it to achieve a maximum measurement range of up to 20 meters.

Our main product iTFS series can be used for obstacle avoidance in mobile robotics, and as a safety sensor for industrial environments to monitor human presence in hazardous areas. It can also be used for detecting vehicle entry and exit in parking garages, among other applications.
